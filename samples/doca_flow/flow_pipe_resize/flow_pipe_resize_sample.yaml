description: "This sample shows how the DOCA Flow pipe resize feature behaves as pipe size increases. Once the pipe reaches 80% of
              its size, a callback is called that preforms the resize of the pipe. The initial max pipe size is configured to 10. Then 80 entries are added
              which will cause pipe resizing 4 times: 10 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64 -> 128. Each of the following packets are related to different resize cycle.
              In the sample odd queue numbers are excluded. For those queues it is optional to call doca_flow_entries_process to get RESIZED event, specifically,
              queue number 1 is skipped during entries processing while the remaining odd queues are not.
              Sample Command Line: ./build/doca_flow_pipe_resize -- -l 60 -r pci/08:00.0,pf0sf[0-1]"
