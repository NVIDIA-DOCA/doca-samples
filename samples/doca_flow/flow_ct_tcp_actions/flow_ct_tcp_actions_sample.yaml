description: "This sample illustrates how to add shared and non-shared actions to CT TCP sessions. This sample adds a shared action
              on one side of the session that placed the value 1 in the packet's metadata, while on the other side of the session (reply direction) a
              non-shared action is placed. The non-shared action simply flips the order of the source-destination IP addresses and port numbers.
              Sample Command Line: ./build/doca_flow_ct_tcp_actions -- -l 60 -r pci/08:00.0,pf0vf0"
